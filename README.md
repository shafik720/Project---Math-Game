# Project---Math-Game

This is a Math Game. Where users have to find the multiplication of two numbers. 
I used Html, Css, Bootstrap and Vanilla Javascript. I also used Local Storage to store the Highest Score. There will be 5 points for each time clicking correct answer, And there will be -2 points if wrong answer is clicked. This game is also fully responsive for mobile view.
